# earthquake-indonesia

The dataset I used for this analysis comes from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kekavigi/earthquakes-in-indonesia/data).
This is a link to a dataset on Kaggle that contains information about **earthquakes in Indonesia**. The dataset was created by **Kekavi** and contains data from the **Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics (BMKG)**. The dataset includes information such as the date, time, location, magnitude, and depth of the earthquakes.
